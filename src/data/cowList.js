Originally developed for use in war for transporting equipage,[1] the bullocks are notable for their great endurance and speed. Their head is elongated with a ridge in the middle and a bulging forehead. The cows in contrast are poor milk-yielders and hence, are classified to be a draught breed.[2]<br/>' +

During Chikka Devaraja Wadiyar\'s reign a department was created within his administration known as "Benne chavadi" literally "butter department" which maintained cows and bulls, branded (with his initial ದೇ /Dē/) and maintained for supplying butter and milk to the royal household. This was taken over by Hyder Ali and he renamed the administrative unit as "Amrit Mahal". The British took an interest in these cattle when Hyder Ali used them to move guns 100 miles in two days to Chelambram during the Battle of Porto Novo and when Tipu Sultan used them to march across south India in a month. They were then adopted for use in the army by the Duke of Wellington. After the defeat of Tipu Sultan, the British allowed them to be maintained by the Maharaja of Mysore but in thirteen years they were found to have regressed. In 1813, the pasture lands known as kaval or Kaaval (Kannada:ಕಾವಲ್) and the cattle were placed under a Captain Harvey of the Madras Commissariat for management of the breed. In 1842, a report stated that the English Army was served efficiently by 230 Mysore bullocks in Afghanistan. In 1860, Charles Trevelyan closed down this unit as being uneconomical but it was re-established in 1867 with the assistance of the Mysore Maharaja and by 1870 about 4000 cows and 100 bulls were under government care.

Though there are no standards for color, most are red to light red, with white mottled spots.

This change led to the need for specialized animals for dairy (and beef) production. Until this time, milk and beef had been produced from dual-purpose animals.

A mature cow weighs about 500 kg (1100 lbs.), while a male weighs between 700 and 800 kg (1500 – 1800 lbs).[3] A cow can produce 2,500 kg of milk per lactation period, which lasts for about 305 days.

The above-average per cow was 2002 in the South Tyrol about 4,836 kg milk per annum, 3.78% milk fat content, and 3.38% protein (8,491 control cows).

			'<br/>' +
			'Like the development of the Santa Gertrudis and the Brangus, the Waguli was developed in an attempt to obtain a heat-tolerant and high quality meat breed. Because the Brahman breed typically yields low quality carcass characteristics, but shows extreme heat tolerance, beef producers have created hybrid crosses such as the Santa Gertrudis (Brahman X Shorthorn) and the Brangus (Brahman X Angus), which are British-Brahman crossed cattle with the hopes of attaining a high quality meat animal with extreme heat tolerance. The Waguli have shown superior meat tenderness in studies conducted at the University of Arizona when compared to purebred Brahman steers. Because the Sanga cattle breeds have been developed over thousands of years from Bos indicus and Bos taurus in the Sub-Saharan regions of Africa, the Tuli are known to be well suited to arid environments. Wagyu cattle are known for their superior marbling traits as they are genetically predisposed to intense marbling. Other hopes for this composite breed are that it will mature at a more rapid rate than its Brangus counterparts, which are known to be slower maturing when compared to traditional European cattle breeds as well as having very poor marbling characteristics in comparison.',
